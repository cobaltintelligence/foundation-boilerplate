          <p id = "description-text">Cobalt Intelligence is an investment and innovation research company with over <X> years of experience within its core team alone. Our focus is to accelerate the development of new technologies and implement the final products into the marketplace more rapidly than what is traditionally observed. This is accomplished using innovation processes provided by our experience working with NASA, the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and other global defense and software companies. In short, we are a technology transfer agent, accelerating the transition of new technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace.</p>

          <p id = "description-text"> Each project is structured with innovation and development at the forefront of our minds. To accomplish these goals with the greatest effect, we also implement ground-floor investors to increase the equity of the project as well as their own return on investment. In addition to guiding the core projects, Cobalt Intelligence acts as a medium between the projects and their investors, providing constant updates on their statuses as well as suggesting expected timelines for completion and project deadlines.

          <p id = "description-text"> <b> Working in unison,</b> Cobalt Intelligence and the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition have collaborated on innovative, groundbreaking projects. </p>

          <p id = "description-text"> <b> Myodeck,</b> a lightweight smart press, originally designed for use in outer space, is one of the first products to come out of the partnership. The device is able to exert up to 800 pounds of force while maintaining a net weight of about 250 pounds. Saving space is another feature of the product since it maintains about the same physical footprint of an actual bench press without the weights. Where free weights often suffer is safety, while Myodeck maintains the same feel as them, its integration of haptic feedback and quick release buttons ensures the user is never put into harm’s way. Through the simultaneous action of measuring and pressing, users may receive feedback real-time to improve form. Collected data will also aid in insurance reimbursement. </p>

          <p id = "description-text"> <b> The Smart Reef™, </b> a fish-sensing underwater structure, is still in early stages of development. Advances in technology combined with expert-designed models blow the competition out of the water through the use of an extensive array of integrated sensors. Syncing collected data among reefs with a proprietary underwater wireless communication platform and then beaming it to the surface in real-time is extremely valuable in scientific research and monitoring use cases. Locals will revel in the fact that it also prevents erosion and rebuilds biomass through creation of a structural root system.</p>

          <p id = "description-text"><b>The Institute for Human and Machine Cognition</b> is a not-for-profit research institute that works with colleges and universities in Florida focusing on human enhancement and capability enhancement.  They focus on creating systems that integrate seamlessly with human behavior and motion. This allows for systems that accentuate the strengths of both the human and machine components. Research at IHMC is currently focused in Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, human interactions with autonomy, language processing, exoskeletons, and other similar fields. Their mission is, “to improve the relationships between humans and the machines they use” </p>

          <p id = "description-text"><b>Founded in 1990</b> by Dr. Kenneth Ford and Dr. Alberto Ca(n)as at the University of West Florida, the institute quickly grew in size and influence. In 2008 Dr. Ford became a chairman of the NASA Advisory Council allowing for more astronomical research opportunities. Since then, IHMC has won multiple DARPA robotics challenges including setting a land speed record in legged robotics.</p>
